## Getting Started

Before you can play the game, you need to set up the environment. The game is written in Python and uses the Pygame library. 

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, you will need to install several Python libraries which our game depends on. These libraries include Pygame, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and several others. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer. You might want to do this in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

You can create a virtual environment and install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'env'
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source env/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install pygame numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Game
Once you've installed Python and Pygame, you can download the game files from this repository and navigate to the game's directory on your system. From there, run the following command to start the game:
```
python run.py
```
