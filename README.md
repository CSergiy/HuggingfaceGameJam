# HuggingfaceGameJam
Our entry into the [Hugging Face Game Jam](https://huggingface.co/blog/game-jam). 

## Getting Started

Before you can play the game, you need to set up the environment. The game is written in Python and uses the Pygame library. 

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip, the Python package installer:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game
Once you've installed Python and Pygame, you can download the game files from this repository and navigate to the game's directory on your system. From there, run the following command to start the game:
```
python run.py
```
